Environmental Sustainability Analysis Project

Project Overview

The goal of this project was to determine which countries are the most environmentally friendly across five key areas:
CO2 Emissions
Air Pollution
Plastic Pollution
Deforestation
Energy Sources

We analyzed various datasets to assess each country's performance in these categories, assigning scores to reflect their environmental impact. From this data, we calculated a comprehensive Green Score for each country, highlighting the top performers. This insight is valuable for environmentally conscious businesses when deciding where to set up operations or allow employee travel with minimal negative environmental impact.

Data Collection, Database Design & Data Transformation

Data Sources: Datasets were sourced from Kaggle and the World Data Bank.
Data Processing: Python was used to clean and preprocess the datasets.
Database Design: Normalized country codes were used as the primary key for each table.
Integration: We integrated SQL with Python for efficient data analysis and insights extraction.

Major Obstacles

Topic and Data Selection: Considerable time was invested in identifying a relevant topic and finding appropriate datasets.
Collaboration with Git: Managing version control in a large group, particularly when using Jupyter Notebooks, posed significant challenges.
SQL Application: Finding meaningful ways to apply SQL with limited prior experience required problem-solving and creativity.
Conclusions and Business Applications

Different countries contribute to various environmental issues, but larger nations (e.g., USA, China) have a significant negative impact in most areas.

Both developing and developed countries contribute to environmental problems.
There is very limited adoption of solar and wind energy across all countries analyzed.
These insights can help businesses minimize their environmental impact by choosing greener destinations for operations or employee travel.
The research could be extended further to consider additional dimensions and factors.

Future Work

Further research could involve exploring more specific environmental metrics and incorporating additional data sources to provide a more comprehensive understanding of each country's environmental impact.
